--[[ Warning
    ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸: it is recommended that: for vehicles that reach more than (124 mph | 200 kmh) have 'USE_MAXSP_LIMIT' enabled in their handling, this
    will make the gear ratios have the ideal spacing to flow without too much revs.

    ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸: vehicles with less than 5 gears will rev more than expected, change the power in 'info' to compensate.

    Changelog:
    + added per vehicle ratio
    + added per vehicle gearRatio
    + added per vehicle rpm smoother control (how fast/slow the rpm will increase/decrease)
    + added more volume options
    + added 'support' for more libraries like 'newmodels'
    + small code cleanup
    + fixed silenced vehicle when spawning inside the detection area (colshape)

    Readme:
    per-vehicle extras(turbo,als and blowoff) now uses a different structure, see below
